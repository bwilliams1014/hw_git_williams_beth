    * I used this extensively to refresh my memory for both CSS and HTML (since I had to withdraw last semester, it's been a while since I coded). I was able to get significant help with flexboxes which I had not used before.
* I downloaded images from the following websites:
	* lions, tiger, and cheetah from pngimg.com
	* Simba and Tigger from yopriceville.com
	* Garfield from hero.wikia.com
	* Cat in the Hat from seuss.wikia.com
	* Puss in Boots from shrek.wikia.com
	* Sylvester from pluspng.com
	* Cheshire Cat from disneyfanon.wikia.com
	* pawprint from clipartix.com
* I got information about cats and big cats from
	* https://pethelpful.com/cats/10-Reasons-Why-Cats-Are-Awesome

## Deductions
"I reviewed the list of deductions for this assignment and in the syllabus."

## Comments
* At first I was overwhelmed with the prospect of coding and entire webpage, even a simple one, since I have not coded anything since last September. Once I got going, it all started coming back. 
* What is the normalize.min.css file? It seems like something was adding some space above and below some of my text and I was wondering if it was something in that file.
