			<h1>Cats are the Coolest Pets</h1>

			<p>Cats are amazing, just look at YouTube! Only cats are hilarious enough to be the biggest celebrities on the web. What is it about cats that makes them cool? Here are the top three reasons why cats rule:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><h2>Cats are independent.</h2>
					<p>Cats can be left by themselves for a while. You can take a short vacation and leave them at home. All they need is enough food and water to make it through. They donâ€™t get separation anxiety and tear up your entire house like dogs do.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h2>Cats don't need to be taken outside to do their business.</h2>
					<p id="wideRightMargin2">Cats instinctively know how to use a litter box. It might not be fun to clean, but the trade-off is that you don't have to rush home to let the cat out.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h2>Cats keep themselves clean.</h2>
					<p id="wideRightMargin3">Cats bathe themselves. Only very rarely do some cats need a bath. Cats don't smell bad either like dogs do. You don't feel like you need to wash your hands after petting them.</p>
				</li>

	      	<h1>Big Cats are Awesome</h1>

	      		<p>Who isn't fascinated by the big cats? Lions, tigers, jaguars, leopards, and snow leopards make up the genus panthera; but only four of the five can roar. While lions are the loudest and can be heard up to 5 miles away, snow leopards can't roar at all. Here are some more interesting facts about the big cats and some of their cousins:</p>

	      	<article id="lions">
	      		<h2>Lions</h2>
	      			<p>Lions are native to Africa and parts of India. They are unique in that the male lion has a full ruff of shaggy hair around its head called a mane. Lions live in family groups called prides and share hunting and cub rearing duties. All of the big cats, including lions, are listed as endangered, near threatened, or vulnerable.</p>

	      		<h2>Tigers</h2>
	      			<p>These majestic creatures have individual stripe patterns that are like fingerprints - no two are the same. Surprisingly, the largest population of tigers in the world is in the United States. There are more tigers in captivity in the US than there are roaming free in the entire world!</p>

	      		<h2>Cheetahs</h2>
	      			<p>Although technically not a part of the big cat family, cheetahs are amazing because they are the fastest land animals. They can run at speeds up to 75 miles per hour. Unlike tigers, cheetahs are hard to tell apart. The entire species was almost wiped out in the last ice age, so the inbreeding that occurred among those that were left has made them nearly indistinguishable from each other.</p>
