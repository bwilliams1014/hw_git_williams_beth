			<h1>Cats are the Coolest Pets</h1>

			<p>Cats are awesome, just look at YouTube! Only cats are hilarious enough to be the biggest celebrities on the web. What is it about cats that makes them cool? It's probably that they pretty much take care of themselves! Here are the top three reasons why cats rule:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><h3>Cats are independent.</h3>
					<p>Cats can be left by themselves for a while. You can take a short vacation and leave them at home. All they need is enough food and water to make it through. They donâ€™t get separation anxiety and tear up your entire house like dogs do.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h3>Cats don't need to be taken outside to do their business.</h3>
					<p>Cats instinctively know how to use a litter box. It might not be fun to clean, but the trade-off is that you don't have to rush home to let the cat out.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h3>Cats keep themselves clean.</h3>
					<p>Cats bathe themselves. Only very rarely do some cats need a bath. Cats don't smell bad either like dogs do. You don't feel like you need to wash your hands after petting them.</p>
				</li>
